It shows the time, the weather for Chattanooga, TN, and has links to all of my most used websites. 
One feature I'm particularly proud of is the search functionality I've built in using [Query Strings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Structure). 
Most websites implement their search using query strings, so this feature is really powerful for things like searching price history of Amazon listings on CamelCamelCamel.

Another cool feature are the searchable accordion lists that I'm using for subreddits. You can search by subreddit name or URL. If the search is drilled down to only one result and you hit Enter, it will navigate to that page. A really quick way to get to a specific subpage of a website that I enjoy using.
