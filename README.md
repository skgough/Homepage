# homepage
My browser homepage that I use on a daily basis.

It shows the time, the weather for Chattanooga, TN, and has links to all of my most used websites. 
One feature I'm particularly proud of is the search functionality I've built in using [Query Strings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Structure). 
Most websites implement their search using query strings, so this feature is really powerful for things like searching price history of Amazon listings on CamelCamelCamel.
